ATTENTION!!! 


First of all, you need to specify the main application’s exe file to launch! And install fonts. To do it follow all of these instructions.

1. Close the ‘GRAVITY '22 System Launcher’ Application
2. Go to '\GRAVITY '22 System Launcher' (Directory of the application)
3. Find the text file named ‘path.txt’ and delete it
4. Create a new text file named ‘path.txt’ in your desktop
5. Copy the path of the application you want to launch including the exe file name and file extension and paste it in the file you created.

Example:
C:\Program Files (x86)\PC Manager 3\ PC Manager.exe

6. Save the file and copy it to the '\ GRAVITY '22 System Launcher' (Directory of the application)
7. Extract the 'fonts.zip' and Install all the fonts in the ‘fonts’ folder
8. It's ready to go. Now you can run the application normally...
